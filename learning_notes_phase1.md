## 📅 Day 1 – November 4, 2025
### 🏁 Focus:
- Set up GitHub account  
- Created QA portfolio repository  
- Learned basic concept of bug reports and documentation structure

### 🧩 What I Did:
- Created repository `qa-portfolio`
- Added `README.md`
- Added `bug_report_example.md` file
- Learned how to document bugs clearly and consistently

### 💡 What I Learned:
- QA = Quality Assurance → focuses on preventing and identifying issues  
- A **Bug Report** must always contain:
  - Title (short, clear)
  - Severity and Priority
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs. Actual result
  - Environment (OS, browser, app version)
- Clear documentation = good tester skill

### 🔜 Next Step:
- Learn how to write **Test Cases** and create `test_case_example.md`
